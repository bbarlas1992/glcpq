			<h3>Increased Selling Time</h3>
			<p>CPQ accelerates sales cycles by automating the proposal and quote process across all channels. Sales professionals can reach more clients and focus on interactions because new quote generation time is reduced with information available electronically across all sales channels, any time. Sales productivity increases when sales reps are empowered to generate quotes without conferring with product experts because all the relevant information, prices and quoting rules are in one easily accessible solution.</p>

			<h3>Remove Barriers to Closing Deals</h3>
			<p>A streamlined internal approval process with automated workflows and pre-defined approval levels for product and service levels allows proposals and quotes to be generated easily and accurately. A CPQ solution should have all the latest pricing information and contain automated special pricing requests, minimizing the time drain on sales operations on reworking and approving requests.</p>
